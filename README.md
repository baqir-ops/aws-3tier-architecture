## 🚀 AWS 3-Tier Architecture Project (VPC + ALB + CloudFront)

# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure and scalable 3-tier architecture on AWS, following real-world cloud best practices.
It focuses on network isolation, traffic routing, and high availability, rather than just application hosting.

The architecture separates:

Frontend layer (public access)

Application layer (private, protected)

Database layer (private, isolated)

This project was built as a hands-on cloud engineering lab to showcase AWS networking, load balancing, and security concepts.

## 🧩 AWS Services Used

-Amazon VPC

- Public & Private Subnets (Multi-AZ)

- Internet Gateway

- Security Groups

- Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Target Groups

- Amazon EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)

- AWS Systems Manager (Session Manager)

- Amazon CloudFront

## 🔐 Networking & Security Design

- ALB deployed in public subnets

- Backend EC2 deployed in private subnets

- Database subnets isolated from public access

- Security Groups used instead of open CIDR rules:

- ALB SG allows HTTP (80) from internet

-Backend SG allows traffic only from ALB SG

- No direct SSH access (managed via SSM Session Manager)

## ⚙️ Load Balancing

- Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Listener: HTTP : 80

- Target Group:

- Type: Instance

- Protocol: HTTP

- Port: 80

- Health checks configured on backend instances

## 🌍 Content Delivery

- CloudFront distribution configured in front of the ALB

- Improves performance and simulates real-world frontend delivery

- Supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Verified ALB DNS resolution

- Verified CloudFront distribution creation

- Validated security group traffic flow

- Confirmed backend isolation from direct internet access

- Troubleshot package installation and connectivity issues

## ⚠️ Known Limitation (Intentional Design Choice)

The backend EC2 instances are deployed in private subnets without a NAT Gateway.

Impact:

- Backend instances do not have outbound internet access

- Package installation (e.g., dnf install httpd) fails due to no NAT

Reason:

- This was a deliberate architectural decision to demonstrate:

- Proper private subnet isolation

- Real-world cloud security design

- Understanding of NAT Gateway requirements

- Improvement (Future Enhancement):

- Add a NAT Gateway in a public subnet

- Allow secure outbound access for updates while keeping instances private

## 💼 Skills Demonstrated

- AWS VPC design (public vs private subnets)

- Load balancing with ALB & target groups

- Secure traffic flow using Security Groups

- CloudFront integration

- Troubleshooting AWS networking issues

- Using AWS Systems Manager instead of SSH

- Cost awareness and architectural trade-offs
